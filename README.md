# 🌸 Flower Classification with CNN

This project focuses on classifying different species of flowers using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture built from scratch. The project aims to explore and apply deep learning techniques in the field of computer vision, making use of various Python libraries such as TensorFlow and Pandas.

## 📝 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a robust flower classification model using CNN. The model is trained on a dataset of flower images and is designed to recognize and classify various species of flowers. 

To enhance the performance and generalization of the model, data augmentation techniques are applied. This makes the model more adaptable and suitable for real-life scenarios where the input data might vary in terms of orientation, lighting, and scale.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Custom CNN Architecture**: The CNN architecture is built from scratch using TensorFlow, showcasing the foundational principles of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers.
- **Data Augmentation**: Various data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming are applied to the training data to prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize.
- **Extensive Use of TensorFlow and Pandas**: TensorFlow is used for building and training the neural network, while Pandas is used for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated on a test dataset to determine its accuracy and performance.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset consists of images of various flower species. Each image is labeled with the corresponding species name, and the dataset is split into training and testing sets.

### Data Augmentation Techniques Used:
- Random rotation
- Horizontal and vertical flipping
- Zooming in and out
- Width and height shifting

These techniques were implemented to artificially increase the size of the training dataset and to help the model learn more robust features.
